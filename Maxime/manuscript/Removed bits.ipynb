    "\n",
    "Classical regression discontinuity designs often suffer from low power, requiring many units near the border for inference to be possible. \n",
    "In the spatial RDD setting, we might worry that the situation is worse, as geographical datasets with many units packed along the border are uncommon. \n",
    "In geographical settings, each unit (e.g. household or counties) normally takes up space, so there is a limit to how densely packed units can be near the border. \n",
    "And boundaries often include sparsely populated segments, e.g. running through parks, industrial areas, or farmland. \n",
    "The intuition that spatial RDDs will therefore suffer from low power is correct, inasmuch as at any given point along the border, the posterior variance of $\\tau(\\border)$ will typically be high. \n",
    "But once we pool the information into an average treatment effect, or perform a sharp test, spatial RDDs can be more powerful than classical RDDs, with the same number of units at the same distance from the border.\n",
    "\n",
    "We illustrate this statement once more with the Louisiana-Mississippi example.\n",
    "The variance of the inverse-variance weighted treatment effect $\\invvar$ is thence only a function of the positions of the units, available analytically by plugging the posterior variance \\eqref{eq:postvar2gp} into the inverse-variance estimator \\eqref{eq:invvar}. \n",
    "Following this procedure, we obtain a posterior standard deviation of the average treatment effect of 0.31. \n",
    "We then create a one-dimensional regression discontinuity design for the same setting, by using each unit's distance from the border as the covariate $x$, the distribution of which is shown in Figure \\ref{fig:mississippi_counties}(b). \n",
    "Following the exact same 2GP procedure with the same hyperparameters as in the spatial setting, and with a discontinuity at $x=0$, we again compute the posterior standard deviation of the treatment effect at the border (now a single number rather than a continuous function) , this time obtaining 0.58. \n",
    "This higher figure indicates that, perhaps counter-intuitively, the spatial experiment actually has more power than its one-dimensional analog.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain intuition about the higher power of the spatial RDD, we turn to the interpretation of regression discontinuity designs as natural experiments [need reference]. \n",
    "Near the discontinuity, we can reasonably claim that the side of the discontinuity that each unit fell into was largely dictated by random noise in the covariate. \n",
    "This in turn allows us to claim that a natural randomized experiment took place near the border, with treatment and control units coming from the same population. \n",
    "We can extend this interpretation to the spatial setting, by conceiving of multiple correlated experiments taking place all along the border. \n",
    "The average treatment effect estimator then pools the information supplied by all of these experiments.\n",
    "The question then becomes: do we get more powerful inference by grouping all the units into a single experiment, or by spreading them along a multitude of weaker experiments?\n",
    "There are two sources of uncertainty in our model: the observation noise $\\epsilon_i$, and the underlying processes $g_\\treat{}$ and $g_\\ctrol{}$. Adding more units to a single experiment allows us to cancel out more of the observation noise, but if the new units aren't added closer to the discontinuity, uncertainty always remains in $g_\\treat{}$ and $g_\\ctrol{}$. In the spatial setting, however, we observe multiple realizations of the Gaussian process, and therefore do not suffer from the same diminishing returns."

    "\n",
    "A particularly intriguing aspect of GeoRDDs is that the treatment effect is a real function defined everywhere on the border, which is a one-dimensional manifold embedded in a two-dimensional space.\n",
    "The geometry makes the very reasonable idea of integrating the treatment effect linearly along the border quite unsuitable.\n",
    "We showed that this ATE estimand is undesirably sensitive to the topology of the border: straight segments are given less weight than wiggly segments of the border, which is unlikely to be the analyst's intention.\n",
    "A more suitable approach is to weight sentinels by the inverse of the posterior covariance, which yields an ATE estimate that is robust to the topology of the border, and is also the minimum variance ATE estimate, thus fully utilizing the information available in the GeoRDD.\n",
    "But it lacks an easily interpretable estimand, motivated as it is by the properties of its posterior: we estimate what we can rather than what we want.\n",
    "Another approach is to project observed units onto the border, instead of evenly spaced sentinels, an take the unweighted mean of the treatment effect estimated at those locations.\n",
    "This estimate is also robust to border topology, and the estimand allows for a finite population interpretation that may feel more natural to practicioners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, when can we say that we have detected a statistically significant treatment effect?\n",
    "We proposed three tests, one based on the inverse-variance weighted ATE, on a marginal likelihood comparison, and a “chi-squared” test.\n",
    "A tail probability can be derived heuristically from the inverse-variance weighted ATE's posterior distribution, but a calibration step, either through a parametric bootstrap or analytically, is necessary to turn this Bayesian pseudo-$p$-value into a valid frequentist $p$-value.\n",
    "Note that the same procedure to obtain a valid test could be followed using any of the average treatment effect estimates defined in Section \\ref{sec:ate}.\n",
    "The second test compares the marginal likelihood under the GeoRDD \\eqref{eq:spec2gp} versus a single Gaussian process with the same covariance parameters spanning both regions, the null model.\n",
    "We argue that the marginal likelihood test is sensitive to model misspecification and doesn't explicitly target the detection of a treatment effect at the border, and therefore do not recommend its use.\n",
    "The “chi-squared test” addresses this issue, as it uses a statistic that is calculated directly  from the border treatment effect's posterior mean vector and covariance matrix.\n",
    "The test statistic is inspired by a classical chi-squared test for testing whether the mean of a multivariate normal distribution is zero, but in this setting it does not have a $\\chi^2$ distribution in this setting.\n",
    "We therefore again use a parametric bootstrap to obtain its null distribution.\n",
    "The “chi-squared” test targets the sharp null hypothesis of no treatment effect anywhere along the border, while the inverse-variance test targets the weak null hypothesis of zero ATE.\n",
    "While the sharp null is more general, we find that the “chi-squared” test has lower power than the inverse-variance test.\n",
    "Therefore, we recommend the use of the inverse-variance test in contexts where the treatment effect, if non-zero, is expected to be mostly positive everywhere, or negative everywhere along the border, or when the average treatment effect is of primary scientific interest."
