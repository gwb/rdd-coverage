    "Geographical regression discontinuity designs (GeoRDDs) are such RDDs where the forcing variables are spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude),\n",
    "meaning that units within a certain region are assigned to treatment, while units in a neighboring region are controls.\n",
    "For example, in <cite data-cite=\"macdonald2015effect\">MacDonald, 2015</cite>, a private police force patrols a neighborhood, but stays out of surrounding areas, and a causal effect on crime rates is sought.\n",
    "In <cite data-cite=\"chen2013evidence\">Chen, 2013</cite>, a policy applies south of the Huai River in China but not in the north, and pollution levels and life expectancies are measured to infer environmental and health impacts of the policy.\n",
    "Practitioners often wish to use the well-established methods and software developed for 1D RDDs for their spatial problem.\n",
    "It is therefore tempting to reduce a GeoRDD problem to a 1D RDD by using the signed distance from the boundary (positive for treatment and negative for control) as the forcing variable, a method that we will refer to as “projected 1D RDD,” and which is used by both examples cited above.\n",
    "However, this method can fail to fully capture the spatial variation in the outcomes, resulting in spatial confoundedness of the estimator.\n",
    "We demonstrate this in a simple example in Appendix \\ref{sec:confounding}.\n",

    "This is slightly different from the method of <cite data-cite=\"imbens2011regression\">Zajonc and Imbens, 2011</cite> for multivariate regression discontinuities that are not geographical, which uses a multivariate local linear regression to estimate the treatment effect at each boundary point, thus avoiding the need to specify a distance metric in the space of covariates.\n",

    "Sentinels placed at equal distance intervals along this border will therefore be more densely packed along the rivers, and sparsest along the straight segment (see Figure \\ref{fig:mississippi_counts}).\n",

    "Worse, the resolution of the map used in the analysis affects the estimated ATE.\n",

    "The dependencies induced by this geometric fact are reflected in the covariance $\\Sigma_{\\sentinels \\mid Y}$: sentinels in the straight segment of the border will be less strongly correlated than in the sinuous segments. \n",

    "This can put negative weights on some sentinels, as seen in a simulated example in Figure \\ref{fig:weight_functions}(c), and generally this estimand doesn't lend itself to an intuitive interpretation.\n",
    "This estimand isn't chosen on scientific grounds, but rather it is dictated by the  observed data.\n",
    "This is counter to the conventional wisdom in causal inference, that the estimand should be chosen based on substantive grounds, ideally before collecting any data.\n",
    "While perhaps unorthodox, analogous “estimands of convenience” have been proposed in other settings, for example matching methods that exclude some unmatched units from the analysis \\citep[discussed in][]{crump2009dealing}, or in the context of balancing treatment and control populations with little overlap in their covariate distributions \\citep{li2016balancing}.\n",
    "The classical RDD could be said to provide another example, as the estimand \\eqref{eq:rdd_univ_estimand} focuses on the treatment effect near the threshold not because those units are of particular substantive interest, but because the available data restricts estimation of the treatment effect elsewhere."

    "For outcomes that vary spatially, a direct comparison of mean outcomes between $\\yt$ and $\\yc$, such as a $t$-test, is an invalid estimator of the treatment effect, as it is confounded by the spatial covariates.\n",
    "However, under smoothness assumptions, units adjacent to the border are comparable, and form a natural experiment.\n",

    "We therefore used Gaussian process regression, known as kriging in the spatial statistics literature, to fit the smooth surfaces to the outcomes in step (1) of our general framework.\n",

    "This is because $s_1$ acts as a hidden confounder, whose distribution changes discontinuously at the border, which leads to bias and inconsistency in the projected 1D RDD estimate.\n",
    "In geographical settings, a discontinuous change in the density of units at the border is not unusual: for example a border could run alongside a park, or a small body of water, therefore with zero population density on one side of the border.\n",
    "A visual inspection of Figure \\ref{fig:sales_map} showing the locations of units in a New York City property sales dataset reveals many examples of this."
