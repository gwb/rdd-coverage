    "There are two sources of uncertainty in our model: the observation noise $\\epsilon_i$, and the underlying processes $g_T$ and $g_C$. Adding more units to a single experiment allows us to cancel out more of the observation noise, but if the new units aren't added closer to the discontinuity, uncertainty always remains in $g_T$ and $g_C$. In the spatial setting, however, we observe multiple realizations of the Gaussian process, and therefore do not suffer from the same diminishing returns."
