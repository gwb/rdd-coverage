    "Secondly, the unweighted mean treatment estimand is affected by the shape of the border between the treatment and control regions.\n",
    "We illustrate this with the border separating two American States: Louisiana and Mississippi.\n",
    "From North to South, the border follows the meandering Mississippi river, then takes a sharp turn to the East and becomes a straight line, until it meets the even more sinuous Pearl river, which it then follows until it reaches the Gulf of Mexico. \n",
    "Sentinels placed at constant intervals along this interval will therefore be most densely packed along the Pearl River, and sparsest along the straight segment of the border (see Figure \\ref{fig::mississippi_counts}).\n",
    "When averaging a function over the border, those sections will therefore be overrepresented. \n",
    "Troublingly, the sinuousness of the border therefore determines the estimand, and the resolution of our map can drastically change our estimate, even though the outcomes of the treatment we are studying might have nothing to do with river topographies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighing the treatment effect at each sentinel location by a local density estimate would address the first issue, but not the second.\n",
    "We view the unwelcome dependence of the $\\linavg$ estimand on the border topography as a side effect of ignoring the fact that the 1-dimensional treatment function $\\tau(\\boundary)$ is embedded in a Euclidean 2-dimensional space. \n",
    "This fact is captured by the covariance structure: sentinels in the straight segment of the border will be less strongly correlated than in the sinuous segments. \n",
    "The more correlated sentinels individually carry less information about the local treatment effect. \n",
    "This suggests that instead of averaging the treatment effect evenly along the border, we wish to average evenly the information contained therein. \n",
    "This motivates the use of the inverse-variance weighted mean $\\invvar$, which efficiently extracts the information from the posterior to produce the weighted avereage with minimum variance.\n",

    "This estimator will automatically give more weight to sentinels in dense areas (as the variance will be lower there), and to sentinels in straight sections of the border. While the estimand is less clear, the approach is in keeping with the philosophy of regression discontinuity designs. We let information be our guide when averaging over our boundary, just like it guided the analysis of regression discontinuity designs to only focus on the treatment effect at the boundary. The estimand isn't chosen by the scientist, but it is dictated by the limitations of the data."

    "\n",
    "Classical regression discontinuity designs often suffer from low power, requiring many units near the boundary for inference to be possible. \n",
    "In the spatial RDD setting, we might worry that the situation is worse, as geographical datasets with many units packed along the boundary are uncommon. \n",
    "In geographical settings, each unit (e.g. household or counties) normally takes up space, so there is a limit to how densely packed units can be near the boundary. \n",
    "And boundaries often include sparsely populated segments, e.g. running through parks, industrial areas, or farmland. \n",
    "The intuition that spatial RDDs will therefore suffer from low power is correct, inasmuch as at any given point along the boundary, the posterior variance of $\\tau(\\boundary)$ will typically be high. \n",
    "But once we pool the information into an average treatment effect, or perform a sharp test, spatial RDDs can be more powerful than classical RDDs, with the same number of units at the same distance from the boundary.\n",

    "$\\label{fig:mississippi_counties}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We illustrate this statement with an example. Considering once more the boundary between Louisiana and Mississippi, we imagine an experiment where the unit of analysis is the county, located at its centroid, as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:mississippi_counties}(a). \n",
    "For simplicity, we fix the hyperparameters to arbitrary values: $\\sigman=\\sigmaf=1.0$ and $\\ell=50\\,\\mathrm{km}$. \n",
    "The variance of the inverse-variance weighted treatment effect $\\invvar$ is thence only a function of the positions of the units, available analytically by plugging the posterior variance \\eqref{eq:postvar2gp} into the inverse-variance estimator \\eqref{eq:invvar}. \n",
    "Following this procedure, we obtain a posterior standard deviation of the average treatment effect of 0.31. \n",
    "We then create a one-dimensional regression discontinuity design for the same setting, by using each unit's distance from the boundary as the covariate $x$, the distribution of which is shown in Figure \\ref{fig:mississippi_counties}(b). \n",
    "Following the exact same 2GP procedure with the same hyperparameters as in the spatial setting, and with a discontinuity at $x=0$, we again compute the posterior standard deviation of the treatment effect at the boundary (now a single number rather than a continuous function) , this time obtaining 0.58. \n",
    "This higher figure indicates that, perhaps counter-intuitively, the spatial experiment actually has more power than its one-dimensional analog.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain intuition about the higher power of the spatial RDD, we turn to the interpretation of regression discontinuity designs as natural experiments [need reference]. \n",
    "Near the discontinuity, we can reasonably claim that the side of the discontinuity that each unit fell into was largely dictated by random noise in the covariate. \n",
    "This in turn allows us to claim that a natural randomized experiment took place near the boundary, with treatment and control units coming from the same population. \n",
    "We can extend this interpretation to the spatial setting, by conceiving of multiple correlated experiments taking place all along the boundary. \n",
    "The average treatment effect estimator then pools the information supplied by all of these experiments.\n",
    "The question then becomes: do we get more powerful inference by grouping all the units into a single experiment, or by spreading them along a multitude of weaker experiments?\n",
    "There are two sources of uncertainty in our model: the observation noise $\\epsilon_i$, and the underlying processes $g_T$ and $g_C$. Adding more units to a single experiment allows us to cancel out more of the observation noise, but if the new units aren't added closer to the discontinuity, uncertainty always remains in $g_T$ and $g_C$. In the spatial setting, however, we observe multiple realizations of the Gaussian process, and therefore do not suffer from the same diminishing returns."
